## Fix Android blank screen on cold start (Clerk Native API off)

Date: 2026-11-09

WHY: Release APK eva-0.1.1 opened to a blank white screen. Clerk rejected the native client (`The Native API is disabled for this instance`), `ClerkLoaded` rendered nothing, and fonts returned `null` with no timeout. Nothing told the user what failed.

Architectural: `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` now exports an expo-router `ErrorBoundary`, waits at most 3 s for fonts, and gates the app on `useAuth().isLoaded`. It also probes Clerk `/v1/environment` so a disabled Native API shows `StartupFailure` (native-ui `EmptyState`) with the real cause instead of a blank screen; a 15 s timeout covers other load failures. `scripts/check-clerk-native-api.sh` fails the release if `native_settings.api_enabled` is not true. Owner must enable Native applications in the Clerk Dashboard (see `apps/mobile/RELEASE.md`).

## Fix Android release Metro bundle (missing Babel JSX plugin)

Date: 2026-11-08

WHY: `:app:createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets` failed with `Cannot find module '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx'`. `nativewind/babel` (via `react-native-css-interop`) names that plugin as a string, and Babel resolves it from `apps/mobile`. pnpm isolation did not link it there.

Architectural: `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is now a direct devDependency of `@eva/mobile`, so pnpm links it where Babel looks. The monorepo stays on the isolated linker.

## Fix main CI gate (lint / compiler / design)

Date: 2026-11-08

WHY: The required `typecheck / lint / compiler / design / schema` check was red on main (28 oxlint errors, 15 new stageshow React Compiler bailouts, design baseline drift), which blocked rebased PRs from going green.

Architectural: Real lint and try-block bailouts were fixed in place; stageshow motion modules that intentionally read refs during render opt out with `"use no memo"` instead of growing the compiler baseline; the design baseline was shrunk for fixed violations only (SVG mask white kept via a targeted ignore).
